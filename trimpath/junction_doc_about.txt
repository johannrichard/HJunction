About: About TrimPath Junction
  Junction is a Model-View-Controller framework for
  developing offline capable, road-warrior friendly web applications, 
  using JavaScript, HTML and CSS as the main application development languages.  

Features:
- *High developer productivity* - Junction follows the popular 
  _conventions-over-configuration_ philosophy and dynamic
  web-MVC (Model View Controller) design pioneered by
  the Ruby on Rails application framework.  You can 
  consider Junction to be a clone and riff of the Ruby on Rails 
  framework into JavaScript.
- *Fealty to web standards* - Junction is meant for developers who 
  have invested into using web standards like HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
  You can leverage all your skills in those important technologies
  when using Junction.  And, if you want to use extra technologies
  and libraries like 
  Prototype/Scriptaculous/jQuery/Dojo/Mochi/Moo/Base/Ajax/Flash/etc, 
  Junction lets you go right ahead and make your web pages 
  shine with your favorite tech.
- *Multiple runtime options* - 
  A web application written using Junction can be run 
  on the server-side in a Rhino-based web application server.
  Or, a Junction-based web application can be run on
  the client-side, hosted within a web page environment, using a 
  browser-local RDBMS to generate pages entirely within the 
  client web browser, without needing to contact a server.
  As a developer, you can create a single application
  codebase using Junction that can run in either or both of 
  these scenarios.
- *Banish conditional code* - As one example, Junction automatically 
  detects if end-users have optional web browser plug-ins 
  like Google Gears installed, and will leverage the Gears 
  client-side RDBMS if available.  Otherwise, Junction 
  automatically downgrades to a simple memory-only 
  SQL database, letting your application code 
  remain free and clear of conditional environment checking logic.
- *Code and database synchronizaton* - Junction supports an
  application codebase updating facility, a database schema 
  migration facility, and a simple database-level 
  record synchronization facility.  Junction aims to ease
  the common 80/20 of application synchronization needs.
- *Responsive UI's* - When hosted in a browser, a Junction-based
  application feels extra snappy, since it can consult with a local
  fast cache of data to display response pages or page 
  fragments immediately to users.  
- *And more* - Check out the documentation for more of what Junction 
  can do for you.
